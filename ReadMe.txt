(1.)

(2A.) Our decision tree outputs the same result as what is shown in the 'expected result' files. The same amount of positive & negative 
examples are correct. However, we ran into a little bug when it comes to outputting the decision tree for 'set2 big'. At first, 
our code would not run as it would run into an 'index out of bound' error. But after doing a little bit of debugging, we found that our 
code takes in splitfeatures that are non-existent (i.e. the splitfeature value is -1). So to take this into account, we added a condition 
in our 'classify' if-condition that ignores the -1 features. By doing so, we can get the code going again and still output the correct 
results as shown in the 'expected results' files. Except with this fix, the decision tree includes a section of "features -1" while the 
rest of the tree's outputs match the expected results.

(2B.) (i.) Our decision tree classifies patients as follows: - In general, the decision tree begins at a feature and branches from that 
feature until it reaches a positive or negative result. Some symptoms are more serious than others, so the depth of that section is not as 
deep as other symptom's branches. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT of >156, a liver big, malaise, then the patient survived Hepatitis - if 
the patient has Varices, an SGOT of >156, and no liver big, then the patient has likely died - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT of <156, 
a liver big, no malaise, and is not a male, then they likely survived. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT of <156, a liver big, no malaise, 
a male, age < 30, then the patient died. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT of <156, a liver big, no malaise, a male, age is not < 30, and 
is on steroids, then the patient survived - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT of <156, a liver big, no malaise, a male, age is not < 30, and 
is not on steroids, then the patient died - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, and bilirubin less than or equal to 2.9, 
age between 31-50, yes fatigue, then the patient survived - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, and bilirubin less than 
or equal to 2.9, age between 31-50, no fatigue, has anorexia, has liver big, has spiders, alk phosphate is < 127, then the patient survived. - if 
the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, and bilirubin less than or equal to 2.9, age between 31-50, no fatigue, has anorexia, has 
liver big, has spiders, alk phosphate not < 127, has steroid, then patient survived. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, 
and bilirubin less than or equal to 2.9, age between 31-50, no fatigue, has anorexia, has liver big, has spiders, alk phosphate not < 127, no 
steroid, then patient died. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, and bilirubin less than or equal to 2.9, age between 
31-50, no fatigue, has anorexia, has liver big, has no spiders, then the patient died. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 
156, and bilirubin less than or equal to 2.9, age between 31-50, no fatigue, has anorexia, has no liver big, then the patient survived. - if 
the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, and bilirubin less than or equal to 2.9, age between 31-50, no fatigue, has no anorexia, 
then the patient survived. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, and bilirubin less than or equal to 2.9, age not between 
31-50, and no fatigue, then the patient survived. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, and bilirubin is not less than or 
equal to 2.9, and has anorexia, then the patient survived. - if the patient has Varices, an SGOT not greater than 156, and bilirubin is not less 
than or equal to 2.9, and does not have anorexia then the patient died. - if the patient does not have Varices, and does have Histology, then 
the patient died. - if the patient does not have Varices and does not have histology, then the patient survived.

(ii.) There are 38 out of 42 correct positive examples (90.47%) There are 7 out of 10 correct negative examples (70%) There are 5 false: negative. 
There are also 5 false:Positive

(3.) (a). The name of the dataset is Stroke Prediction Dataset (b). We obtained the dataset from Kaggle.com (c). 
Our final dataset has 11 features: gender, age (true if older than 50, otherwise false), hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, 
work_type, residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, and smoking status We did a little bit of data cleaning first before testing our data with our 
decision tree. For example, for work type, we put 'false' if the person is a 'children' or if they have never worked. For avg_glucose_level, we 
separated it into true if the person has a healthy level of glucose and false if not. This concept we applied to other features such as bmi. 
Using this dataset, we are trying to predict if the person has had a stroke or not given the features.

(d). In each of our datasets, we have 51 examples (e). The number of features for each dataset is 10

Our decision tree on stroke data performs averagely. This can be due to the fact that we cut our examples size down significantly from the 
given samples to not overwhelm our program. Thus, we had less data to train our decision tree. Additionally, to give our data binary values, 
we had to generalize certain features, such as clustering the age groups into two instead of it being individual. The tree classifies data by 
looking at the feature with the most information gain and branches with the next best information gain feature.

Positive Examples correct: 37 out of 51 (72.5%) Negative Examples correct: 35 out of 51 (68.6%)

6 false: positives 10 false: negatives

Disclaimer: To make our code simpler, we simply copy-pasted our dataset over to one of the pre-existing datasets so that we don't have to code 
for our dataset case. We still have the old dataset that we pasted over and saved to another text file for testing purposes. We pasted our dataset 
on train_pos2-small, train_neg2-small, test_pos2-small, and test_neg2-small (to run our data set, just simply run 'java TestClassifier set2 small').
